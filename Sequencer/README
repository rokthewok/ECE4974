Required to build:
	Qt4 libraries
	JACK audio libraries

To build:

		Super Savvy Sequencer
-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
Super Savvy Sequencer provides a simple way to make interesting one-bar melodies
and loops. Functionality includes:
	- up to 6 distinct pitches
	- variable tempo
	- ability to manipulate amplitude, waveform, and pitch of each line
	- WAV file saving with options for number of repeats

Known issues:
	- If you wish to open up a saved waveform in, say, Audacity,
		the sequencer app must be closed first. For some reason,
		Audacity (or JACK or ALSA) doesn't like sharing or
		being shared.
