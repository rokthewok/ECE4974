To install:
	simply run the makefile! Type "make" into the command line.
To run:
	the program takes three command line arguments, in order;
	filename, harmonicity, and modulation index. The filename must
	end with ".wav". Harmonicity and modulation index are both
	floating point values. For example,

	./fm_test my_fm_wave.wav 1.2 1.5

	would produce a wav file in the "res" folder entitled "my_fm_wave.wav".
	The wave would be a 5 second tone with carrier frequency 440Hz,
	harmonicity of 1.2 and modulation index of 1.5.
